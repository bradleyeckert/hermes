# 5.4 Software detailed design

## 5.4.1 Refine SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE Subdivide software into SOFTWARE UNITS

The MANUFACTURER shall refine subdvide the software ARCHITECTURE until it is represented by
SOFTWARE UNITS.
NOTE Some SOFTWARE SYSTEMS are not divided further.

## 5.4.2 Develop detailed design for each SOFTWARE UNIT

The MANUFACTURER shall develop and document a detailed design with enough detail to allow
correct implementation of for each SOFTWARE UNIT of the SOFTWARE ITEM. {Class C}

## 5.4.3 Develop detailed design for interfaces

The MANUFACTURER shall develop and document a detailed design for any interfaces between
the SOFTWARE UNIT and external components (hardware or software), as well as any interfaces
between SOFTWARE UNITS, detailed enough to implement each SOFTWARE UNIT and i ts interfaces
correctly. {Class C}

## 5.4.4 Verify detailed design

The MANUFACTURER shall verify and document that the software detailed design:
a) implements the software ARCHITECTURE; and
b) is free from contradiction with the software ARCHITECTURE.
{Class C}
