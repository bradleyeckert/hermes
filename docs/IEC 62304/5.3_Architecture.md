# 5.3 Software ARCHITECTURAL design

## 5.3.1 [ARCHITECTURE](./glossary.md#ARCHITECTURE) based on software [requirements](./5.2_Requirements.md)

**mole** is a [SOFTWARE ITEM](./glossary.md#SOFTWARE_ITEM) with the following 
[SYSTEM](./glossary.md#SYSTEM) requirements:

1. Lock down UARTs or other ports using strong authenticated encryption.
2. Prevent spoofing by not using PKE.
3. Support key rotation.
4. Encrypt and decrypt files, data logs, and boot firmware.
5. Recover easily from corrupted data.

There are two kinds of incoming streams that **mole** has to deal with:
Those with real-time requirements and those without.
An RS-232 port is an example of a real-time stream.
The stream is buffered to prevent overflows, but the software typically spends a lot of time waiting for input.
The options for waiting are:

1. Block while waiting. Use a preemptive RTOS to perform other tasks. This has huge overhead.
2. Yield control to another task while waiting, using a cooperative scheduler. Much simpler.
3. Return control to the main thread while waiting using an FSM. Requires no context switch or RTOS.

Option 3 is chosen for **mole** to maximize portability.
The calling application shares its thread by passing incoming stream bytes to **mole** for processing.

### 5.3.1.1 mole software units

The **mole** [SOFTWARE ITEM](./glossary.md#SOFTWARE_ITEM) consists of three [SOFTWARE UNITS](./glossary.md#SOFTWARE_UNIT):

- `mole.c`, the mole API
- `xchacha.c`, encryption/decryption primitives
- `blake2s.c`, one-way hash and HMAC primitives

For readability, C source files avoid forward references even though the inclusion of
`#include "mole.h"` at the beginning of the file makes that unnecessary.
Internal functions are declared `static` so their scope is guaranteed local to the file.
If a function is referenced, it is most likely declared further up in the file.

### 5.3.1.2 mole
**mole** uses pre-arranged keys. They are called keysets. A keyset consists of:

- A 32-byte user passcode
- A 16-byte admin passcode
- A 16-byte HMAC

The user passcode is passed through a KDF (key derivation function) to generate encryption
and signature keys. If an encryption key or signing key were discovered through a side-channel attack,
it cannot be used to produce the other key or the user passcode.

The port structure `port_ctx` has receive and transmit buffers, and functions to support
transmission and reception.
Each port in the system is declared with `port_ctx` and initialized using `moleAddPort`.
Encryption functions are late-bound, loaded into `port_ctx` by `moleAddPort` by the selected protocol.
`moleAddPort` allocates memory at run time, since the sizes of contexts used by cryptographic
primitives are unknown until the protocol is selected,
with static stack-like structure instead of `malloc`.

The **mole** API is an ad-hoc collection of functions that send different kinds of messages to a client's `molePutc` function.

`molePutc` is the only function that has a real architecture.
It is implemented as a Finite State Machine.
Incoming bytes are fed into `molePutc` one at a time and processed per the current state.
The stages of `molePutc` are sequential:

1. Check for escape sequences, which filter raw 0x0A bytes from binary data and capture the HMAC.
2. Append the binary byte to the hash whether it's hashed or not.
3. Process the byte per the current state of the state machine.
4. When a message has been received, call its output function.
5. Exit `molePutc`.

### 5.3.1.3 xchacha HMAC
This version of [xchacha](https://github.com/bradleyeckert/xchacha) is from a Github repository.
It is based on a [reference](https://github.com/spcnvdr/xchacha20) implementation and uses the same test vectors.
The main feature is its streaming API designed to interface to **mole**.
This API consists of:
```C
/** Encryption/decryption initialization
 * @param ctx   Encryption/Decryption context
 * @param key   Key, 32 bytes
 * @param iv    Initialization vector, 16 bytes
 */
void xc_crypt_init(xChaCha_ctx *ctx, const uint8_t *key, const uint8_t *iv);

/** 16-byte block encryption/decryption
 * @param ctx   Encryption/Decryption context
 * @param in    16-byte buffer holding the input data
 * @param out   16-byte buffer holding the output data
 * @param mode  ignored
 */
void xc_crypt_block(xChaCha_ctx *ctx, const uint8_t *in, uint8_t *out, int mode);
```

### 5.3.1.4 blake2s HMAC
This version of [Blake2s](https://github.com/bradleyeckert/blake2s) is from a Github repository.
It is based on a [reference](https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2) implementation and uses the same 2MB of test vectors.
The main feature is its streaming API designed to interface to **mole**.
This API consists of:

```C
/** HMAC initialization
 * @param ctx   HMAC context
 * @param key   Key, 32 bytes
 * @param hsize Expected hash length in bytes
 * @param ctr   64-bit counter to prevent replay attacks, may be initially 0
 * @return      Actual hash length in bytes (0 if bogus)
 */
int b2s_hmac_init(blake2s_state *S, const uint8_t *key, int hsize, uint64_t ctr);

/** HMAC append byte
 * @param ctx   HMAC context
 * @param c     Byte to add to HMAC
 */
void b2s_hmac_putc(blake2s_state *S, uint8_t c);

/** HMAC append byte
 * @param ctx   HMAC context
 * @param out   Output hash
 * @return      Hash length in bytes
 */
int b2s_hmac_final(blake2s_state *S, uint8_t *out);
```
**mole** supplies it a 32-bit key and a 64-bit counter at the beginning of a hash stream,
appends one byte at a time to the hash stream, and finalizes the hash stream to produce a 16-byte HMAC.

Blake2s takes care of the internal buffering needed to allow the hash to be processed in 64-byte chunks.
63 out of every 64 `b2s_hmac_putc` calls take almost no time. The 64th call is when the hash function executes.

## 5.3.2 Develop an ARCHITECTURE for the interfaces of SOFTWARE ITEMS

The interfaces to **mole** are in `mole.h`. The error codes defined there are:

| Error Macro                | Meaning                                              |

Clears the port list, which is a static one-time stack. Call before **moleAddPort**.
May be used to wipe contexts before exiting an app so sensitive data doesn't hang around in memory.

### 5.3.2.2 int moleAddPort
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name        | Usage                                     |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| mole_WrKeyFn    | WrKeyFn     | Function to overwrite the key             |

Used to configure one or more **mole** ports.
The typedefs of the functions are:

```C
typedef void (*mole_boilrFn)(const uint8_t *src);  // handle received boilerplate
typedef void (*mole_plainFn)(const uint8_t *src, int length); // handle message
typedef void (*mole_ciphrFn)(uint8_t c);           // output raw ciphertext byte
typedef uint8_t* (*mole_WrKeyFn)(uint8_t* keyset); // write new keyset
```

### 5.3.2.3 int moleNewKeys
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code; usually MOLE_ERROR_BAD_HMAC

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name | Usage                                                           |
| --------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx  | Port identifier                                                 |
| const uint8_t\* | key  | 32-byte user passcode, 16-byte admin passcode, and 16-byte HMAC |

Loads new keys into the port.

### 5.3.2.4 int molePutc
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef    | Name | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| port_ctx\* | ctx  | Port identifier  |
| uint8_t    | c    | Incoming byte    |

Input raw ciphertext (or command), such as received, from a UART or other input stream.

**molePutc** is a FSM that invokes various functions set by **moleAddPort**.

### 5.3.2.5 int moleTxInit
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef    | Name | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| port_ctx\* | ctx  | Port identifier  |

Send an IV to enable moleSend, needed if not paired.

### 5.3.2.6 int moleSend
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name  | Usage                       |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx   | Port identifier             |
| const uint8_t\* | m     | Plaintext message to send   |
| int             | bytes | Length of message in bytes  |

Encrypt and send a message out the **ciphr** function.

### 5.3.2.7 int moleReKey
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name  | Usage                       |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx   | Port identifier             |
| const uint8_t\* | key   | Passcode to transfer        |

Encrypt and send a re-key message, returns key.
The flow sequence is:

- Alice encrypts and sends a "re-key" message to Bob
- If Bob accepts the key, Bob sends a re-key message to Alice

If Alice does not receive a re-key message, something went wrong:

1. Bob did not accept the new key and is still using the old key.
2. Bob was re-keyed, but Alice did not get the message.

In case 1, Alice keeps using the old key, re-pair, and tries again.

In case 2, Alice tries to the new key and keeps it if it works.

Such application-level error handling is outside the domain of **mole**.

### 5.3.2.8 int moleAvail
Return value: Capacity of the far end's receive buffer.

Parameter list:

| Typedef    | Name | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| port_ctx\* | ctx  | Port identifier  |

Get number of bytes allowed in a message

### 5.3.2.9 int molePair
Return value: None

Parameter list:

| Typedef    | Name | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| port_ctx\* | ctx  | Port identifier  |

| Typedef    | Name | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| port_ctx\* | ctx  | Port identifier  |

Send a boilerplate request

### 5.3.2.11 int moleAdmin
Return value: None

Parameter list:

| Typedef    | Name | Usage            |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| port_ctx\* | ctx  | Port identifier  |

Send the administrative passcode in the keyset.
A keyset may contain or omit the passcode depending on access requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### File encryption

File encryption is done in 16-byte blocks using the following functions:

- int  moleFileNew (port_ctx \*ctx);
- void moleFileOut (port_ctx \*ctx, const uint8_t \*src, int len);
- void moleFileFinal (port_ctx \*ctx);

The output stream is like a train. The boilerplate and IV initialization are the locomotive,
the chunks are rail cars, and the HMAC of the entire data is the caboose.
This chain of chunks, where the IV is counter-based, localizes damage from data corruption.
One bad bit will wipe out the HMAC of a rail car, not the whole train.
The final HMAC will fail, but most of the data in the file will not be lost or un-authenticated.
Also, an isolated chain is useless. It must be connected to the locomotive.

### 5.3.2.12 int moleFileNew
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name  | Usage                       |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx   | Port identifier             |

Output boilerplate and IV preamble

### 5.3.2.13 void moleFileOut
Return value: None

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name  | Usage                       |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx   | Port identifier             |
| const uint8_t\* | src   | Plaintext to encrypt        |
| int             | len   | Length in bytes             |

Encrypt and output a message. The message length must be a multiple of 16.
If the chunk being created surpasses a length set by MOLE_FILE_CHUNK_SIZE_LOG2,
that chunk is terminated with a HMAC and a new chunk is started.

The reason for breaking the file into chunks is for error tolerance.
Chunks are an exact power of 2 bytes in length, including padding.
When counting or seeking chunks, they start at predictable file positions.
A bad chunk does not irretrievably corrupt the file structure.

### 5.3.2.14 void moleFileFinal
Return value: None

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name  | Usage                       |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx   | Port identifier             |

Finish the file output by sending the HMAC of the last chunk and the HMAC of the overall set of chunks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.2.15 int moleFileIn
Return value: 0 if okay, else error code.

Parameter list:

| Typedef         | Name  | Usage                         |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| port_ctx\*      | ctx   | Port identifier               |
| mole_inFn       | cFn   | Input function                |
| mole_outFn      | mFn   | Output function, NULL if none |

Decrypts a file created by moleFileNew, moleFileOut, and moleFileFinal.
The function typedefs are:

```C
typedef int (*mole_inFn)(void); // returns 0 to 255, -1 if end-of-stream
typedef void (*mole_outFn)(uint8_t c);
```

## 5.3.3 Functional and performance requirements of SOUP item

**mole** uses two cryptographic primitives that are SOUP items.
**xchacha** is an encryption function and **blake2s** is a hash function.
These algorithms are chosen for their high performance and small code size.

Their performance and size requirements are application-dependent.
If a communication channel is faster than **mole**, it will just be slowed down.
The slowdown shall not be significantly noticable to the user.

## 5.3.4 Specify SYSTEM hardware and software required by SOUP item

The SOUP requires any system that compiles and runs C code.
For verification, the SOUP's testbenches shall be run through [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).

## 5.3.5 Identify segregation necessary for RISK CONTROL

Segregation from other [SOFTWARE ITEMS](./glossary.md#SOFTWARE_ITEM) is performed by not including
the `mole.h` header file in them.

A file that includes `mole.h` has access to the mole library as well as the `port_ctx` data structure.
Encapsulation shall be the domain of the application, which should have a file that:

- Includes the `mole.h` header file
- Declares and initializes all ports in the system
- Interfaces to **mole**

**mole** itself encapsulates the cryptographic primitives, verified by inspection.

Encapsulation of a system that uses **mole** is verified by software inspection:

- Search for files where `mole.h` is included.
- Ensure that those files do not expose **mole** internals.

## 5.3.6 Verify software ARCHITECTURE

The MANUFACTURER shall verify and document that:
a) the ARCHITECTURE of the software implements SYSTEM and software requirements including
those relating to RISK CONTROL;
b) the software ARCHITECTURE is able to support interfaces between SOFTWARE ITEMS and
between SOFTWARE ITEMS and hardware; and
c) the MEDICAL DEVICE ARCHITECTURE supports proper operation of any SOUP i tems.
NOTE A TRACEABILITY analysis of ARCHITECTURE to software requirements can be used to satisfy requirement a).
