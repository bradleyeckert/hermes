## <a name="SDLC"></a>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE MODEL (SDLC)
Conceptual structure spanning the life of the software from definition of its requirements to its
release for manufacturing, which:

– identifies the [PROCESS](#PROCESS), [ACTIVITIES](#ACTIVITY) and [TASKS](#TASK) involved in development of a [MEDICAL DEVICE](#MEDICAL_DEVICE) [[SOFTWARE PRODUCT](#SOFTWARE_PRODUCT)](#SOFTWARE_PRODUCT),
– describes the sequence of and dependency between [ACTIVITIES](#ACTIVITY) and [TASKS](#TASK), and
– identifies the milestones at which the completeness of specified [DELIVERABLES](#DELIVERABLES) is verified.

## <a name="SOFTWARE_ITEM"></a>SOFTWARE ITEM
Any identifiable part of a computer program, i.e., source code, object code, control code,
control data, or a collection of these items
NOTE Three terms identify the software decomposition. The top level is the [SOFTWARE SYSTEM](#SOFTWARE_SYSTEM).
The lowest level that is not further decomposed is the [SOFTWARE UNIT](#SOFTWARE_UNIT).
All levels of composition, including the top and bottom levels, can be called SOFTWARE ITEMS.

A [SOFTWARE SYSTEM](#SOFTWARE_SYSTEM), then, is composed of one or more SOFTWARE ITEMS, and each
SOFTWARE ITEM is composed of one or more SOFTWARE UNITS or decomposable SOFTWARE ITEMS. The responsibility
is left to the [MANUFACTURER](#MANUFACTURER) to provide the definition and granularity of the SOFTWARE ITEMS and SOFTWARE UNITS.

The SOFTWARE ITEM hides the internals of its [SOFTWARE UNIT](#SOFTWARE_UNIT)s.

Example:
```
SOFTWARE SYSTEM             \ Application
   SOFTWARE ITEM #1         \ Encryption library
      SOFTWARE UNIT #1.1
      SOFTWARE UNIT #1.2
   SOFTWARE ITEM #2         \ Bootloader
      SOFTWARE UNIT #2.1
      SOFTWARE UNIT #2.2
   SOFTWARE ITEM #3         \ Debugger
      SOFTWARE UNIT #3.1
      SOFTWARE UNIT #3.2
```
In this example, the bootloader and debugger both use the encryption library.
The implementation hierarchy is not a simple tree.
However, the verification hierarchy is generally a simple tree.

NOTE: SOFTWARE UNITS can be used for the purpose of software configuration management or testing.
The granularity of SOFTWARE UNITS is defined by the [MANUFACTURER](#MANUFACTURER).

## <a name="SOUP"></a>SOUP

developed for the purpose of being incorporated into the [MEDICAL DEVICE](#MEDICAL_DEVICE) (also known as off-the-
shelf software) or [SOFTWARE ITEM](#SOFTWARE_ITEM) previously developed for which adequate records of the
development [PROCESS](#PROCESS)ES are not available.

NOTE: A [MEDICAL DEVICE](#MEDICAL_DEVICE) [SOFTWARE SYSTEM](#SOFTWARE_SYSTEM) in itself cannot be claimed to be SOUP.
