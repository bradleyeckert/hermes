# Mole software development process

The IEC 62304 standard,
"Medical device software â€“ Software life cycle processes",
has an 8-step software development process:

5.1 - Software development planning  
5.2 - Software requirements analysis  
5.3 - Software ARCHITECTURAL design  
5.4 - Software detailed design  
5.5 - SOFTWARE UNIT implementation  
5.6 - Software integration and integration testing  
5.7 - SOFTWARE SYSTEM testing  
5.8 - Software release

The relevant sections of the software development process are:

- [Development Planning](./5.1_DevPlanning.md)
- [Requirements](./5.2_Requirements.md)
- [Architecture](./5.3_Architecture.md)
- [Detailed Design](./5.4_Detailed_design.md)
- [Verification](./5.5_Verification.md)

Being a SOFTWARE UNIT, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8 are outside the scope of `mole`.
Irrelevant sections of 5.1 and 5.3 are also omitted.

The requirements for inclusion are triggered by:

- 5.3.2 Develop an ARCHITECTURE for the interfaces of SOFTWARE ITEMS
- 5.4.2 Develop detailed design for each SOFTWARE UNIT
- 5.5.2 Establish SOFTWARE UNIT VERIFICATION PROCESS
