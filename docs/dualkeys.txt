There can be multiple pre-shared keys, each with different access privileges.
This is used in Mifare DESfire cards.
A successful pairing would first be done using key set 0.
Further commands elevate access privilege (flip to a different key, like turning the knob on a VINSON box).
The "admin access" command uses a 16-byte password.
