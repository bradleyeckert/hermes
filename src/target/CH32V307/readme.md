# Embeetle project for CH32V30x

microcontroller: ch32v307vct6
board: [ch32v307vct6-evt-r1-1v1](https://embeetle.com/#supported-hardware/wch/boards/ch32v307vct6-evt-r1-1v1)

The original WCH sources provide three startup assembly files:
- startup_ch32v30x_D8.S
- startup_ch32v30x_D8C.S

The application folder contains main.c, which implements the UART interface.
